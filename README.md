Breakout Remake

Originally developed by Atari in 1976. An effective evolution of Pong, Breakout ditched the two-player mechanic in favor of a single-player game where the player, still controlling a paddle, was tasked with eliminating a screen full of differently placed bricks of varying values by deflecting a ball back at them.

This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on modern systems.
